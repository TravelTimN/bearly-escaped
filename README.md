# [Bearly Escaped](https://traveltimn.github.io/bearly-escaped/)

Bearly Escaped was a startup business concept in Dublin, Ireland designed in 2015 to promote fun Escape Rooms. The site was originally built using WordPress through the witchcraft of several unnecessary plugins over the course of 6+ months in 2016.

I rebuilt this site in 3 days using my skills learned through the Code Institute Full Stack software development course, testing my abilities to build the project from scratch without several plugins through WordPress.
